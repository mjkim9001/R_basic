## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x=rnorm(100)
hist(x, probability = T)
lines(density(x), type='h', col='red')
shapiro.test(x)
```
```{r}
grade = sample(0:100, 80, replace=T)
plot(grade, col=ifelse(grade>=60, 2, 5), 
     pch=ifelse(grade>=60, 10, 15))
abline(h=60, col=2, lwd=2)
```


```{r}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
